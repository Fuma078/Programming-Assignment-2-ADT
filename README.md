## Description
The **Simple Text Analyzer** is a Java program that reads a text file (`input1.txt`) and analyzes its contents by counting characters, words, palindromes, emoticons, and lines. It also identifies the longest word and calculates the average word length while measuring execution time. Key features include text tokenization, palindrome detection, emoticon recognition, and performance measurement.

## Installation
To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Save the provided Java code as `SimpleTextAnalyzer.java`.
3. Place an input text file named `input1.txt` in the same directory.
4. Compile the program using:
   ```sh
   javac SimpleTextAnalyzer.java
   ```
5. Run the program with:
   ```sh
   java SimpleTextAnalyzer
   ```

## Usage
This program reads a text file (`input1.txt`) and analyzes its contents by counting characters, tokens, palindromes, emoticons, and new lines. It also calculates the longest token size and average token length.

## Features
- **Character Count**: Counts the total number of characters in the file.
- **Palindrome Detection**: Identifies and counts palindromic words.
- **Words Count**: Counts the total number of words in the file.
- **Emoticon Detection**: Recognizes basic emoticons such as `:)`, `:D`, and `:(`.
- **Line Count**: Counts the number of lines in the file.
- **Longest Word**: Determines the size of the longest word.
- **Average Length of Words**: Computes the average length of words.
- **Execution Time**: Measures the time taken to execute the program.

This program provides a simple and efficient way to analyze text files using Java.
